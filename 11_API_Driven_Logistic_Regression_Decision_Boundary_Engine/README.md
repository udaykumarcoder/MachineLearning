PROJECT 11 — REAL-TIME NETWORK SECURITY LOGISTIC REGRESSION ENGINE
--------------------
Platform: Google Colab

Language: Python

Libraries: Requests, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn

Submission: Google Colab Notebook

Problem Statement
------------------
An enterprise network security platform automates request classification into Standard (0) or Anomalous (1). You must write a dynamic REST API fetching function to pull live data from GitHub CSV endpoints, merge network traffic logs with host telemetry, train a Logistic Regression classifier, inspect sigmoid probabilities, and evaluate accuracy across custom decision boundaries.


LIVE API ENDPOINTS

FLOW_LOGS_API_ENDPOINT = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv"
HOST_TELEMETRY_API_ENDPOINT = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv"

  TASKS & EXPECTED OUTPUTS
  ----------------------------
  TASK 1 — Live API Ingestion & Feature PreprocessingFetch both datasets via fetch_api_data(). Clean penguins.csv by dropping rows with missing values (dropna()). Map target species to binary classification (Adelie -> 0, Other -> 1). Extract continuous features (bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g).

Expected Output:
---------------------

[TASK 1 SUCCESS] API Data Fetched Successfully!

TASK 2 — Stratified Train-Test Split & Feature Scaling
Separate predictive features from the target variable (Is_Anomalous). Perform a 70% Train / 30% Test split stratified on the target label using random_state=42. Scale continuous features using StandardScaler.

Decision Threshold Tuning:
- Threshold @ 0.30 (Strict): 97.0% Accuracy | Precision: 0.9655 | Recall: 0.9821 (Maximizes detection for suspicious traffic)
- Threshold @ 0.50 (Normal): 98.0% Accuracy | Precision: 0.9821 | Recall: 0.9821 (Balanced baseline model performance)

Conclusion:
By implementing dynamic REST API fetching, the data pipeline dynamically ingests raw security logs over HTTP. Logistic Regression maps continuous features to calibrated sigmoid probability scores, enabling security operations teams to tune decision boundaries based on system risk tolerance.
