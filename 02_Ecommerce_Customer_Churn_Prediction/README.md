Problem Statement:
---------------------
An e-commerce company wants to predict whether a customer will churn (cancel their account). Currently, customer service flags churn using manual rules (e.g., inactive for over 30 days and spent less than $50). The company wants to structure their raw customer logs into features and targets to move toward an ML-based prediction system. 

Sample Input
-------------
Customer_ID,Account_Age_Days,Monthly_Spend,Support_Calls,Inactivity_Days,Churn
C101,120,45.5,4,35,Yes
C102,450,120.0,0,5,No
C103,90,25.0,5,40,Yes
C104,300,85.0,1,12,No
C105,210,60.0,2,20,No
C106,60,15.0,6,45,Yes
C107,500,200.0,1,8,No

TASK 1 — Create the DatasetCreate the above dataset using Pandas.

TASK 2 — Display Dataset Information
------------------------------------
Display the number of rows, columns, and column names.  

Expected Output:
----------------
Number of Rows    : 7
Number of Columns : 6

Columns:
Customer_ID
Account_Age_Days
Monthly_Spend
Support_Calls
Inactivity_Days
Churn

TASK 3 — Identify Features and Target
----------------------------------------
Identify input features vs. target label and explain why Customer_ID is excluded.  

Expected Output:

Features:
Account_Age_Days
Monthly_Spend
Support_Calls
Inactivity_Days

Target:
Churn

Customer_ID is an arbitrary unique identifier and contains no predictive pattern.

TASK 4 — Count Churned and Retained Customers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Calculate the count of churned vs. retained customers.  

Expected Output:
Churn Status Counts:
No     4
Yes    3


TASK 5 — Calculate Average Inactivity Days
-----------------------------------------
Calculate average inactivity days for churned vs. active customers. 
Expected Output:
Average Inactivity Days:
Churned Customers   : 40.0 days
Retained Customers : 11.25 days


TASK 6 — Apply a Rule-Based Prediction
-----------------------------
Apply company rule: 
IF Inactivity_Days > 30 AND Monthly_Spend < 50 THEN Churn = Yes ELSE No

Expected Output:
------------------
Customer_ID    Actual    Prediction
C101           Yes       Yes
C102           No        No
C103           Yes       Yes
C104           No        No
C105           No        No
C106           Yes       Yes
C107           No        No


TASK 7 — Calculate Rule Accuracy  
-------------------------------
Compare predictions against actual outcomes.

Expected Output:
-----------------
Correct Predictions : 7
Total Predictions   : 7
Rule-Based Accuracy : 100%


TASK 8 — Test New Customer Scenarios 
------------------------------------
Evaluate two new customers with the current rule: 

Customer A: Inactivity_Days = 32, Monthly_Spend = 150.0, Support_Calls = 6
Customer B: Inactivity_Days = 28, Monthly_Spend = 30.0, Support_Calls = 8

Expected Output:
------------------
Customer A Prediction : No
Customer B Prediction : No

Analysis: Customer B has 8 support calls and high inactivity, but the rule outputs "No" because Monthly_Spend isn't under $50. Rule-based systems miss complex combined factors.


TASK 9 — Identify Features & Labels in Real-World Context
-----------------------------
Display the foundational definitions of Data, Features, and Target Labels. 

Expected Output:
------------------
FEATURES & LABELS FOUNDATIONS

Features (X) : Input measures provided to the model (e.g., Inactivity_Days, Support_Calls).
Target (y)   : The ground-truth answer the model tries to learn/predict (e.g., Churn).

FINAL EXPECTED OUTPUT
---------------------
========== CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS ==========

Total Customers        : 7
Churned Customers      : 3
Retained Customers     : 4

Average Inactivity
Churned                : 40.0 days
Retained               : 11.25 days

Rule-Based Accuracy    : 100%

New Customer A Pred    : No
New Customer B Pred    : No

Conclusion:
Hardcoded rules fail when missing complex interactions (like high support calls).
ML models dynamically balance all input features simultaneously.
