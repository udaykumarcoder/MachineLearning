PROBLEM 6 — REAL ESTATE ASSET VALUATION (REGRESSION)

Platform: Google Colab

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy

Submission: Google Colab Notebook

Problem Statement
A commercial property investment firm evaluates valuation models for real estate acquisitions. Rather than relying on a single dataset, you are provided with 3 relational tables: Property Listings, Neighborhood Analytics, and Macroeconomic Indicators. You must perform a multi-table relational join across 50 records, analyze continuous variable correlations, build feature-target mappings for regression, and formulate explicit task outputs.

FINAL EXPECTED OUTPUT
---------------------
========== COMMERCIAL PROPERTY REGRESSION ANALYSIS ==========

Master Dataset Records     : 50
Total Feature Attributes   : 8
Supervised Paradigm        : Regression (Continuous Target)

Target Metrics (Price_USD_M):
- Minimum Price            : $0.29M
- Maximum Price            : $3.50M
- Mean Price               : $1.49M

Key Feature Correlations:
- Top Positive Predictor   : Area_SqFt (+0.983)
- Top Negative Predictor   : Distance_City_KM (-0.915)

Valuation Sub-Group Profiling:
- High Value (> $1.5M)     : Mean Area = 3,760.87 SqFt | Mean Distance = 2.87 KM | Mean School Rating = 9.20
- Moderate Value (<= $1.5M): Mean Area = 1,770.37 SqFt | Mean Distance = 11.22 KM | Mean School Rating = 6.85

Conclusion:
Multi-table integration confirms property prices are strongly driven by continuous physical attributes (Area) and spatial neighborhood metrics (Distance/School Rating). Linear and Regularized Regression models are optimal candidate baselines.
